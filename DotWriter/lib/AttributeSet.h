   * the value converts to "false", and it is available, Prism, a proximity
   * graph-based algorithm, is used to remove node overlaps. This can also be

   * scaling up, controlled by the overlap_scaling attribute, which can remove a
   * significant portion of the overlap. The prism option also accepts an
   * optional non-negative integer suffix. This can be used to control the
   * number of attempts made at overlap removal. By default, overlap="prism" is
   * equivalent to overlap="prism1000". Setting overlap="prism0" causes only the
   * scaling phase to be run.
   *
   * If Prism is not available, or the version of Graphviz is earlier than 2.28,
   * "overlap=false" uses a Voronoi-based technique. This can always be invoked
   * explicitly with "overlap=voronoi".
   *
   * If the value is "scalexy", x and y are separately scaled to remove
   * overlaps.
   *
   * If the value is "compress", the layout will be scaled down as much as
   * possible without introducing any overlaps, obviously assuming there are
   * none to begin with.
   *
   * N.B.The remaining allowed values of overlap correspond to algorithms which,
   * at present, can produce bad aspect ratios. In addition, we deprecate the
   * use of the "ortho*" and "portho*".
   *
   * If the value is "vpsc", overlap removal is done as a quadratic optimization
   * to minimize node displacement while removing node overlaps.
   *
   * If the value is "orthoxy" or "orthoyx", overlaps are moved by optimizing
   * two constraint problems, one for the x axis and one for the y. The suffix
   * indicates which axis is processed first. If the value is "ortho", the
   * technique is similar to "orthoxy" except a heuristic is used to reduce the
   * bias between the two passes. If the value is "ortho_yx", the technique is
   * the same as "ortho", except the roles of x and y are reversed. The values
   * "portho", "porthoxy", "porthoxy", and "portho_yx" are similar to the
   * previous four, except only pseudo-orthogonal ordering is enforced.
   *
   * If the layout is done by neato with mode="ipsep", then one can use
   * overlap=ipsep. In this case, the overlap removal constraints are
   * incorporated into the layout algorithm itself. N.B. At present, this only
   * supports one level of clustering.
   *
   * Except for fdp and sfdp, the layouts assume overlap="true" as the default.
   * Fdp first uses a number of passes using a built-in, force-directed
   * technique to try to remove overlaps. Thus, fdp accepts overlap with an
   * integer prefix followed by a colon, specifying the number of tries. If
   * there is no prefix, no initial tries will be performed. If there is nothing
   * following a colon, none of the above methods will be attempted. By default,
   * fdp uses overlap="9:prism". Note that overlap="true", overlap="0:true" and

   *
   * By default, sfdp uses overlap="prism0".
   *
   * Except for the Voronoi and prism methods, all of these transforms preserve
   * the orthogonal ordering of the original layout. That is, if the x
   * coordinates of two nodes are originally the same, they will remain the
   * same, and if the x coordinate of one node is originally less than the x
   * coordinate of another, this relation will still hold in the transformed
   * layout. The similar properties hold for the y coordinates. This is not
