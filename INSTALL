== License:

This program is released under the GNU General Public License version 3 by Bas Fagginger Auer.
See COPYING for more information.

== Requirements:

(1) Linux development environment (g++, make, ...) (GNU 4.8.5 works but shows warning about lacking C++11 support.)
(2) CMake
(3) NVIDIA's CUDA development libraries and tools (CUDA must be < 11.0 for Kepler cards).
(4) Boost development libraries ("1.53.0" works; required components: iostreams program_options regex)
(5) Intel's Threading Building Blocks library (Intel 2020 works.)
(6) gnuplot (optional)

== Compilation:

From the current directory, issue:

(1) mkdir build
(2) cd build
(3) cmake ..
(4) make

This should produce a match executable in build/bin.

== Generating the benchmark data:

After building the software, run from the current directory (not the build directory):

(1) ./stats.sh /where/the/graphs/are
(2) ./test.sh (optional)
(3) ./scaling.sh /where/the/scaling/matrices/are
(4) ./benchmark.sh

This will produce the benchmark data for the results section of the paper.
Plots can be generated by loading random1.p, random2.p, weighted1.p, weighted2.p, weighted3.p, weighted4.p, and randomscale.p using gnuplot in the results/ directory.
