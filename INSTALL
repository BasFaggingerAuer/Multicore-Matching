== License:

This program is released under the GNU General Public License version 3 by Bas Fagginger Auer.
See COPYING for more information.

== Requirements:

(1) Linux development environment (g++, make, ...)
(2) CMake
(3) NVIDIA's CUDA development libraries and tools
(4) Boost development libraries
(5) Intel's Threading Building Blocks library
(6) gnuplot (optional)

== Compilation:

From the current directory, issue:

(1) mkdir build
(2) cd build
(3) cmake ..
(4) make

This should produce a match executable in build/bin.

== Generating the benchmark data:

After building the software, run from the current directory (not the build directory):

(1) ./stats.sh /where/the/graphs/are
(2) ./test.sh (optional)
(3) ./scaling.sh /where/the/scaling/matrices/are
(4) ./benchmark.sh

This will produce the benchmark data for the results section of the paper.
Plots can be generated by loading random1.p, random2.p, weighted1.p, weighted2.p, weighted3.p, weighted4.p, and randomscale.p using gnuplot in the results/ directory.
